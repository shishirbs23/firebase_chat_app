# Firebase Chat App

This Flutter project is a simple chat application featuring user authentication (login with email and password), user session management, room joining, real-time chat functionality, and push notifications. We used `go_router` for navigation, `flutter_riverpod` for state management, and `flutter_hooks` for reactive programming.

## Getting Started

This project serves as a great starting point for developing a Flutter chat application with Firebase integration.

To get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Flutter installed. If not, follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
3. Set up your Firebase project and add the necessary configuration files (`google-services.json` for Android or `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS) to the `android/app` or `ios/Runner` directory respectively.
4. Run `flutter pub get` to install the project dependencies.
5. Launch the app on an emulator or physical device using `flutter run`.
